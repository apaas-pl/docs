# Application Platform as a Service (aPaas)

aPaaS allows for rapid application development and delivery. This form has high productivity and high control. The coding process for platforms as a service can slow down delivery, but aPaaS brings automation for the application lifecycle. aPaaS offers a faster way to build apps.


The application platform sits between software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).
aPaaS, like IaaS, includes infrastructure – servers, networking, and data center storage – but also operating systems, analytics, database management, and development tools.

SaaS is essentially software that is always available online, easily accessible through subscription and often updated without disturbing the users one bit. Examples of SaaS are Netflix and Spotify.

SaaS may be built on top of aPaaS, but this isn’t a requirement. In the case of APIfoundation, we build all our apps on our own platform. And you can do this too.
